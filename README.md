# Minimum-Dances
This C# program finds the minimum distance between equal elements in an array. The `minimumDistances` function compares all pairs of elements, calculates the distance for matching values, and keeps track of the smallest distance found. If no duplicates exist, it returns -1. The `Main` method reads the array from input, calls the function, and outputs the result.
